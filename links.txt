📂 Assignment Overview
You are expected to explore and analyze the relationship between trader behavior and market
sentiment using two key datasets.
📂 Datasets
1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset**
- Columns: `Date`, `Classification` (Fear / Greed)
2. **Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid**
- Columns include: `account`, `symbol`, `execution price`, `size`, `side`, `time`, `start position`,
`event`, `closedPnL`, `leverage`, etc.
📂 Objective
Analyze how trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume, leverage) aligns or diverges from
overall market sentiment (fear vs greed). Identify hidden trends or signals that could influence
smarter trading strategies.
